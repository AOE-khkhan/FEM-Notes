# FEM-Notes
Class notes for introductory finite element methods using Python based code. You can [download it here](https://github.com/jgomezc1/FEM-Notes/raw/master/main.pdf).

## IPython Notebooks
Notebooks in IPython are a powerful tool to present programming/math ideas (and are close to [Literate Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)). We have some Notebooks complementing the class notes:

* [Lagrange interpolation](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AppliedMechanics-EAFIT/FEM-Notes/blob/master/notebooks/lagrange_interpolation.ipynb) shows an example of Lagrange interpolation for further use in the derivation of finite element basis functions.
* [Gauss integration of Finite Elements](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AppliedMechanics-EAFIT/FEM-Notes/blob/master/notebooks/gauss_integration.ipynb) presents the common procedure of integrating finite elements, and how it is done using [Gauss quadrature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature).
* [Ritz Method](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AppliedMechanics-EAFIT/FEM-Notes/blob/master/notebooks/ritz_method.ipynb) introduces the concept of calculus of variations and shows the Ritz method, that is the base of the Finite Element Method.
