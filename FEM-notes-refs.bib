  abstract = {ignificant finite element research was conducted at the University
	of California at Berkeley during the period 1957 to 1970. The initial
	research was a direct extension of classical methods of structural
	analysis which previously had been restricted to one-dimensional
	elements. The majority of the research conducted was motivated by
	the need to solve practical problems in Aerospace, Mechanical and
	Civil Engineering. During this short period the finite element method
	was extended to the solution of linear and nonlinear problems associated
	with creep, incremental construction or excavation, crack closing,
	heat transfer, flow of water in porous media, soil consolidation,
	dynamic response analysis and computer assisted learning of structural
	analysis. During the last six years of this period the fields of
	structural analysis and continuum mechanics were unified. The computer
	programs developed during this early period at Berkeley were freely
	distributed worldwide allowing practicing engineers to solve many
	new problems in structural mechanics. Hence, the research was rapidly
	transferred to the engineering profession. In many cases the research
	was used professionally prior to the publication of a formal paper},

	obsolete, his mathematics later enabled him to solve difficult problems
	in applied sciences. He thereby revolutionized the variational calculus

	periodic structures, such as compliant tube gratings [A. C. Hennion
	et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 1861–1870 (1990)]. In this paper,
	the same approach is extended to doubly periodic structures, such
	as Alberich anechoic coatings. To do this, only the unit cell of
	the periodic structure, including a small part of the surrounding
	fluid domain, has to be meshed, due to the use of classical Bloch
	type relations. Then, the effects of the remaining fluid domain are
	accounted for by matching the pressure field in the finite element
	mesh with simple plane wave expansions of the ingoing and outgoing
	waves. After an outline of the method, the paper describes the results
	obtained for the scattering of a plane wave by different periodic
	structures. Internal losses are taken into account and the incident
	plane wave impinges at normal or oblique incidence. Numerical results
	obtained for Alberich anechoic coatings are first analyzed to check
	the convergence and then compared to previous numerical results or
	to experimental results, demonstrating that the finite element approach
	is accurate and well suited to predict the behavior of these gratings.
	Moreover, careful attention is devoted to the analysis of the inclusion
	vibrations, to identify the origin of the resonance mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Rayleigh's classical book Theory of Sound was first published in 1877.
	In it are many examples of calculating fundamental natural frequencies
	of free vibration of continuum systems (strings, bars, beams, membranes,
	plates) by assuming the mode shape, and setting the maximum values
	of potential and kinetic energy in a cycle of motion equal to each
	other. This procedure is well known as “Rayleigh's Method.” In 1908,
	Ritz laid out his famous method for determining frequencies and mode
	shapes, choosing multiple admissible displacement functions, and
	minimizing a functional involving both potential and kinetic energies.
	He then demonstrated it in detail in 1909 for the completely free
	square plate. In 1911, Rayleigh wrote a paper congratulating Ritz
	on his work, but stating that he himself had used Ritz's method in
	many places in his book and in another publication. Subsequently,
	hundreds of research articles and many books have appeared which
	use the method, some calling it the “Ritz method” and others the
	“Rayleigh–Ritz method.” The present article examines the method in
	detail, as Ritz presented it, and as Rayleigh claimed to have used
	it. It concludes that, although Rayleigh did solve a few problems
	which involved minimization of a frequency, these solutions were
	not by the straightforward, direct method presented by Ritz and used
	subsequently by others. Therefore, Rayleigh's name should not be
	attached to the method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, classical and enriched Finite element formulations
	to impose Bloch-periodic boundary conditions are proposed. Bloch-periodic
	boundary conditions arise in the description of wave-like phenomena
	in periodic media. We consider the quantum-mechanical problem in
	a crystalline solid, and derive the weak formulation and matrix equations
	for the SchrÄodinger and Poisson equations in a parallelepiped unit
	cell under Bloch-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, respectively.
	For such second-order problems, these conditions consist of value-
	and derivative-periodic parts. The value-periodic part is enforced
	as an essential boundary condition by construction of a value-periodic
	basis, whereas the derivative-periodic part is enforced as a natural
	boundary condition in the weak formulation. We show that the resulting
	matrix equations can be obtained by suitably specifying the connectivity
	of element matrices in the assembly of the global matrices or by
	modifying the Neumann matrices via row and column operations. The
	implementation and accuracy of the new formulation is demonstrated
	via numerical examples for the three-dimensional Poisson and Schrodinger
	equations using classical and enriched (partition-of-unity) higher-order
	Funite elements.},

	essential book for engineers and mathematicians. The new edition
	is a complete solids and structures text and reference in its own
	right and forms part of the world-renowned Finite Element Method
	series by Zienkiewicz and Taylor.
	
	New material in this edition includes separate coverage of solid continua
	and structural theories of rods, plates and shells; extended coverage
	of plasticity (isotropic and anisotropic); node-to-surface and 'mortar'
	method treatments; problems involving solids and rigid and pseudo-rigid
	bodies; and multi-scale modelling.
