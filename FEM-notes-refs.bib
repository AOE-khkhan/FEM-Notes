For ease of use, a simple utilitarian and tutorial approach is adopted in the initial chapters, introducing the basic background needed to learn the method. Simple but detailed instructions for its application to heat transfer and stress analyses are then dealt with, before moving on to more complex formulations in the later chapters. Fully supported by numerous case studies, this is a comprehensive guide to the subject.},

  Abstract                 = {ignificant finite element research was conducted at the University of California at Berkeley during the period 1957 to 1970. The initial research was a direct extension of classical methods of structural analysis which previously had been restricted to one-dimensional elements. The majority of the research conducted was motivated by the need to solve practical problems in Aerospace, Mechanical and Civil Engineering. During this short period the finite element method was extended to the solution of linear and nonlinear problems associated with creep, incremental construction or excavation, crack closing, heat transfer, flow of water in porous media, soil consolidation, dynamic response analysis and computer assisted learning of structural analysis. During the last six years of this period the fields of structural analysis and continuum mechanics were unified. The computer programs developed during this early period at Berkeley were freely distributed worldwide allowing practicing engineers to solve many new problems in structural mechanics. Hence, the research was rapidly transferred to the engineering profession. In many cases the research was used professionally prior to the publication of a formal paper},

  Abstract                 = {The so-called Ritz--Galerkin method is one of the most fundamental tools of modern computing. Its origins lie in Hilbert's “direct” approach to the variational calculus of Euler--Lagrange and in the thesis of Walther Ritz, who died 100 years ago at the age of 31 after a long battle with tuberculosis. The thesis was submitted in 1902 in Göttingen, during a period of dramatic developments in physics. Ritz tried to explain the phenomenon of Balmer series in spectroscopy using eigenvalue problems of partial differential equations on rectangular domains. While this physical model quickly turned out to be completely obsolete, his mathematics later enabled him to solve difficult problems in applied sciences. He thereby revolutionized the variational calculus and became one of the fathers of modern computational mathematics. We will see in this article that the path leading to modern computational methods and theory involved a long struggle over three centuries requiring the efforts of many great mathematicians.},

  Abstract                 = {Rayleigh's classical book Theory of Sound was first published in 1877. In it are many examples of calculating fundamental natural frequencies of free vibration of continuum systems (strings, bars, beams, membranes, plates) by assuming the mode shape, and setting the maximum values of potential and kinetic energy in a cycle of motion equal to each other. This procedure is well known as “Rayleigh's Method.” In 1908, Ritz laid out his famous method for determining frequencies and mode shapes, choosing multiple admissible displacement functions, and minimizing a functional involving both potential and kinetic energies. He then demonstrated it in detail in 1909 for the completely free square plate. In 1911, Rayleigh wrote a paper congratulating Ritz on his work, but stating that he himself had used Ritz's method in many places in his book and in another publication. Subsequently, hundreds of research articles and many books have appeared which use the method, some calling it the “Ritz method” and others the “Rayleigh–Ritz method.” The present article examines the method in detail, as Ritz presented it, and as Rayleigh claimed to have used it. It concludes that, although Rayleigh did solve a few problems which involved minimization of a frequency, these solutions were not by the straightforward, direct method presented by Ritz and used subsequently by others. Therefore, Rayleigh's name should not be attached to the method.},

This edition sees a significant rearrangement of the book's content to enable clearer development of the finite element method, with major new chapters and sections added to cover:

    Weak forms

    Variational forms

    Multi-dimensional field problems

    Automatic mesh generation

    Plate bending and shells

    Developments in meshless techniques

Focusing on the core knowledge, mathematical and analytical tools needed for successful application, The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals is the authoritative resource of choice for graduate level students, researchers and professional engineers involved in finite element-based engineering analysis.

    A proven keystone reference in the library of any engineer needing to understand and apply the finite element method in design and development.
    Founded by an influential pioneer in the field and updated in this seventh edition by an author team incorporating academic authority and industrial simulation experience.
    Features reworked and reordered contents for clearer development of the theory, plus new chapters and sections on mesh generation, plate bending, shells, weak forms and variational forms.},
