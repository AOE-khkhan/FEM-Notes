	of the method. For ease of use, a simple utilitarian and tutorial
	approach is adopted in the initial chapters, introducing the basic
	background needed to learn the method. Simple but detailed instructions
	for its application to heat transfer and stress analyses are then

  year = {1999},
  abstract = {ignificant finite element research was conducted at the University
	of California at Berkeley during the period 1957 to 1970. The initial
	research was a direct extension of classical methods of structural
	analysis which previously had been restricted to one-dimensional
	elements. The majority of the research conducted was motivated by
	the need to solve practical problems in Aerospace, Mechanical and
	Civil Engineering. During this short period the finite element method
	was extended to the solution of linear and nonlinear problems associated
	with creep, incremental construction or excavation, crack closing,
	heat transfer, flow of water in porous media, soil consolidation,
	dynamic response analysis and computer assisted learning of structural
	analysis. During the last six years of this period the fields of
	structural analysis and continuum mechanics were unified. The computer
	programs developed during this early period at Berkeley were freely
	distributed worldwide allowing practicing engineers to solve many
	new problems in structural mechanics. Hence, the research was rapidly
	transferred to the engineering profession. In many cases the research
	was used professionally prior to the publication of a formal paper},

	a long battle with tuberculosis. The thesis was submitted in 1902
	in Göttingen, during a period of dramatic developments in physics.
	Ritz tried to explain the phenomenon of Balmer series in spectroscopy
	using eigenvalue problems of partial differential equations on rectangular
	domains. While this physical model quickly turned out to be completely
	obsolete, his mathematics later enabled him to solve difficult problems
	in applied sciences. He thereby revolutionized the variational calculus
	and became one of the fathers of modern computational mathematics.
	We will see in this article that the path leading to modern computational
	methods and theory involved a long struggle over three centuries
	requiring the efforts of many great mathematicians.},

  abstract = {Rayleigh's classical book Theory of Sound was first published in 1877.
	In it are many examples of calculating fundamental natural frequencies
	of free vibration of continuum systems (strings, bars, beams, membranes,
	plates) by assuming the mode shape, and setting the maximum values
	of potential and kinetic energy in a cycle of motion equal to each
	other. This procedure is well known as “Rayleigh's Method.” In 1908,
	Ritz laid out his famous method for determining frequencies and mode
	shapes, choosing multiple admissible displacement functions, and
	minimizing a functional involving both potential and kinetic energies.
	He then demonstrated it in detail in 1909 for the completely free
	square plate. In 1911, Rayleigh wrote a paper congratulating Ritz
	on his work, but stating that he himself had used Ritz's method in
	many places in his book and in another publication. Subsequently,
	hundreds of research articles and many books have appeared which
	use the method, some calling it the “Ritz method” and others the
	“Rayleigh–Ritz method.” The present article examines the method in
	detail, as Ritz presented it, and as Rayleigh claimed to have used
	it. It concludes that, although Rayleigh did solve a few problems
	which involved minimization of a frequency, these solutions were
	not by the straightforward, direct method presented by Ritz and used
	subsequently by others. Therefore, Rayleigh's name should not be
	attached to the method.},
